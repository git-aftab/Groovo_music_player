ðŸŽµ Music Player Web App â€“ PRD
1. Overview

This is a fully functional music player web app inspired by Spotify. It will be built primarily with frontend technologies and will include Firebase (or similar BaaS) for authentication and user profile management. Music files will be stored locally, and playlists will be stored in localStorage for persistence.

The app will provide users with a modern, sleek, and responsive interface to browse, play, and organize music.

2. Goals & Objectives

Provide a simple, lightweight music streaming experience with a modern UI.

Enable users to sign up, sign in, and manage profiles via Firebase.

Allow users to browse songs, play/pause/skip, and manage playlists locally.

Offer Spotify-like functionality to the extent possible with frontend-only implementation.
